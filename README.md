This is a Spring Boot application developed as a proof of concept to illustrate seamless integration with Amazon Athena
using
the AWS SDK for Java.

The application demonstrates how to setup, configure, and execute SQL queries against Athena from
within a Spring Boot environment. This project serves as a practical example for anyone looking to leverage Athena's
capabilities for querying data directly stored in Amazon S3 in Spring.

Inspired by the official [AWS Athena Java code samples by Amazon](./info/athena-code-samples.md) at the time of creation
and the
following [`AmazonAthenaSpringBootPOC` GitHub repository](https://github.com/contactsunny/AmazonAthenaSpringBootPOC.git).
